#  Sugarcane Production Data Analysis
This project analyzes global **sugarcane production**, including comparisons across countries and continents.  
The goal is to identify patterns in production, yield efficiency, acreage distribution, and per-person production using Python and data visualization.

---
##  Project Objectives
- Explore global sugarcane production by country and continent  
- Analyze acreage and yield efficiency  
- Identify top 10 producing countries  
- Study relationships between:
  - Production vs Acreage  
  - Yield vs Continent  
  - Production per person  
- Generate correlation heatmaps for deeper insights  
- Visualize patterns using Seaborn & Matplotlib  

---
##  Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Country**
- **Continent**
- **Production (Tons)**
- **Production per Person (Kg)**
- **Acreage (Hectare)**
- **Yield (Kg/Hectare)**

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
