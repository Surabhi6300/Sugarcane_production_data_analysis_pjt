# 🌾 Sugarcane Production Data Analysis

This project analyzes global **sugarcane production**, including comparisons across countries and continents.  
The goal is to identify patterns in production, yield efficiency, acreage distribution, and per-person production using Python and data visualization.

---

## ✅ Project Objectives
- Explore global sugarcane production by country and continent  
- Analyze acreage and yield efficiency  
- Identify top 10 producing countries  
- Study relationships between:
  - Production vs Acreage  
  - Yield vs Continent  
  - Production per person  
- Generate correlation heatmaps for deeper insights  
- Visualize patterns using Seaborn & Matplotlib  

---

## 📘 Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Country**
- **Continent**
- **Production (Tons)**
- **Production per Person (Kg)**
- **Acreage (Hectare)**
- **Yield (Kg/Hectare)**
